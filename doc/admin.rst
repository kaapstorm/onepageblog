The Admin Interface
===================

*onepageblog* is written using the Django_ web framework, and takes full 
advantage of the admin interface that Django offers.

To log in, go to http://your.blog.url/admin/ (where "your.blog.url" is the URL 
of your blog). You will be prompted for your username and password. These are
the username and password you set when you populated the database with initial 
settings on installation.

The first time you log in, set yourself as a member of the Moderators user 
group. This will allow you to preview posts on the site before they are 
published, and you will get e-mail notification when users submit posts to be 
published.

Also go to the Sites section, and edit the "example.com" site. (Do not delete 
it.) Change the domain name and display name to values that correspond with 
your own site.

Most of your time will be spent in the Posts section. This is where you add new 
posts, and publish existing ones.
