Adding Posts
------------

You can add posts either by using the Admin interface, or the "Send Us A Post" 
link at the top of the page.

The Admin interface allows you to publish a post immediately, and set the 
post's summary. You may find it convenient, though, to keep a post unpublished 
until you are happy with it. To preview a post on the site, make sure you are 
a member of the Moderators user group, otherwise you will be unable to see 
unpublished posts.

The "Send Us A Post" link is offered to encourage participation from readers. 
When a post is submitted using the "Send Us A Post" link, notification is 
e-mailed to members of the Moderators user group.

Users can use Markdown_ for content markup.

Moderating Posts
----------------

When they are logged in, members of the Moderators user group can see 
unpublished posts as they would appear on the site to the public when they are 
published. Through the Admin interface they can edit and delete posts.


The Posts RSS Feed
------------------

An RSS 2.0 feed of published posts is available at the url "/feed/rss20.xml".
